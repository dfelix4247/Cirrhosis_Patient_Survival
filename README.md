# Cirrhosis_Patient_Survival

For what purpose was the dataset created?  
Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver carried out from 1974 to 1984.

Goal?
Use a multi-class approach to predict the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis.
